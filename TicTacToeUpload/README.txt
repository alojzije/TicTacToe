This is a really simple TicTacToe app. Human vs Machine. It doesn't have the most thrilling game play as the algorithm  which decides where to mark the space is quite unsophisticated to say the least. My focus was mainly on learning how to listen and react on user input, how to change View attributes in code, and recreate an activity. And I decided to build the app precisely for these reasons, and because it was a fun thing to do.
The hardest part was trying to save the state of the game on orientation change, but ultimately I ran out of time and decided not to submit that "buggy" version. So this version doesn't the app just ignores those changes.
In the future I'd like to continue building apps for my own learning purposes.

Dear reader, I hope you find this app to be at least a little bit enjoyable :)
